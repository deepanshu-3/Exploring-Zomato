# Exploring Zomato 
 Zomato Data Exploration Project Using SQL  Project Overview  This project focuses on exploring and analyzing Zomato’s sales and customer data using SQL. By working with multiple datasets — including user information, product details, sales transactions, and membership sign-ups — we derive key insights into customer behavior, product popularity, and revenue generation.  Datasets Used  Users: Contains user IDs and their initial signup dates.  Gold Users Signup: Tracks the users who signed up for the Zomato Gold membership along with their signup dates.  Sales: Records product purchases made by users with timestamps.  Product: Includes product information such as product names and prices.  Objectives & Analysis Performed  Total Amount Spent by Each Customer: Calculated the total revenue generated from each customer’s purchases.  Customer Visit Frequency: Determined the number of distinct days each customer visited Zomato.  First Product Purchased: Identified the first product bought by each customer.  Most Purchased Item: Found the most frequently purchased product and its purchase count across all users.  Most Popular Item per Customer: Determined each customer’s favorite product based on purchase frequency.  First Purchase After Becoming a Gold Member: Identified the first product purchased by customers after enrolling in the Zomato Gold program.  Last Purchase Before Becoming a Gold Member: Tracked the product purchased just before becoming a Gold member.  Pre-Gold Membership Spending: Calculated total orders and spending before customers joined the Gold program.  Customer Points Calculation: Implemented a points system where product purchases translate into Zomato points based on item-specific rules.  First-Year Points Post Gold Membership: Analyzed points earned by Gold members during their first year in the program.  Transaction Ranking: Ranked customer transactions chronologically.  Gold Membership Transaction Ranking: Assigned transaction ranks only for periods when customers were Gold members, with non-Gold transactions marked as 'NA'.  Tools & Technologies  SQL (Structured Query Language)  MySQL or any SQL-compatible RDBMS  How to Use  Clone this repository.  Set up the provided SQL scripts in your SQL environment.  Execute queries step by step to explore the Zomato data.  Modify and expand the queries for deeper insights.  Future Scope  Visualize insights with tools like Power BI or Tableau.  Implement advanced SQL techniques like CTEs and window functions.  Predict customer behavior using SQL-based data modeling.
